# The8PuzzleAndAStar

A machine learning project which undertook how to solve a sliding picture puzzle in the smallest number of stpes using both hamming and A-Star search.

The picture puzzle consisted of a 3x3 grid in which one cell was removed. The remaining squares were allocated a number from 1-8. The goal of the algorithm is to sort the randomly generated grid from 1-8 with the final missing square being in the bottom right. It calculated this by "sliding" one square at a time till the correct order was found.
